# Planning a Vacation using Python and OpenWeatherAPI

## WeatherPy

The inital goal of this project was to visualize 500 randomly selected cities weather data, and look for trends in cities approaching the equator.
- citipy and OpenWeatherAPI were used to accomplish this.

## VacationPy

The secondary goal was to plot the same weather data on a map, and using a set of conditions, choosing a small number of "vacation spots" that meet the critera. 
- jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API were used. 


The process used along with visualizations can be found in each respective Jupyter Notebook. Screenshots can also be found in the "output_data" folders.
